# SwapBoard

## Welcome!
Hey Everyone!, this is bigals, intial creator, and designer of swap-board.
First off, welcome! This silly project started as a way to stay sharp, while my day job was stuck in the stone ages, and I felt the need to stay relevant. It grew from a simple friendly informal exchange system at a work place, that I thought could be better if we all knew who was ready to trade what items.

## An Important Note On Use
Swap-Board is at its core simply a social board where a group of users can post items to available to trade, and propose trades
with others. The agreement of a trade is where this application STOPS. There is to never be any monetary exchange take place in lieu
of what is considered a standard goods trade. That is one tradeable item may be swaped for another tradeable item of the same 
type/category. The creator(s) of this software take no responsibility for the misuse of the software outside of the prescribed means,
and without the explicit consent of the creator(s).
