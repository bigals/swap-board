# Cotribution GuideLines
## Contributions
If you have something you would like to add to the source code...
* Start by cloning the repository to your local machine with the git clone command.
* Next, create a branch of the name either 'feature/my-descriptive-name' or 'bug/issue-###' depending on if you are adding a feautre 
or a bug, and where ### represents the issue number associated with the bug you are fixing.
* Make your code changes on your branch commiting often and frequently, following best practices with descriptive commit messages
* Push your branch up to the github servers so that your branch is visible in the web app.
* Go to github and find your branch and submit a merge request for bigals to Approve. Only bigals may approve code commits/merges to the master branch
* bigals will get to your merge request as soon as possible and once approved code will be merged to master, and deployed to production after a successfull build

## Style/Coding Standards
Put simply, this code base will as frequently as possible adhere to the official Angular style guide found on the Angular.io website
Link coming soon. If you cant find it with goolgle searching in the mean time, reach out to bigals and he will provide a link

## Testing Expectations
As a whole everyone should be contributing unit tests at a minimum with every merge request, and if it makes sense a e2e test as well. This standard applies to all contributors, including bigals. With the exception that bigals will take the executive priveledge to commit whatever source as part of the intiial MVP with or without testing, in the interest of producing a product quicker. That said, merge requests will be denied, and asked for additional work befor acceptance if these items are missing.

# Developer Experience
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
